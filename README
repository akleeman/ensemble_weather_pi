Ensemble WEather Plugin for OpenCPN
===========================================

A tool for fetching and displaying ensemble forecasts, see www.ensembleweather.com

Thanks to Sean D'Epagnier for his Weather Routing plugin which was used as a
template for this plugin.  A lot of the plotting and installation tools were
taken directly from that project.

Compiling
=========

* git clone git://github.com/akleeman/ensemble_weather_pi.git

Under windows, you must find the file "opencpn.lib" (Visual Studio) or "libopencpn.dll.a" (mingw) which is built in the build directory after compiling opencpn.  This file must be copied to the plugin directory.

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* make install

For OSX standalone build in ensemble_weather_pi directory:
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* make create-pkg
